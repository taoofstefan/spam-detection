**Email Spam Detection Project**

The code represents a text classification project focused on email spam detection. It utilizes the Enron email dataset, a widely used benchmark for spam detection.

The project involves the following steps:

Preprocessing: The email data is preprocessed by splitting it into training and testing sets.

Feature Extraction: The data is transformed using a machine learning pipeline that includes a CountVectorizer to convert text into token counts and a TfidfTransformer to apply TF-IDF transformation.

Classification Model: The transformed data is then fed into an SGDClassifier, a linear classifier, to train a model for email spam detection.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data. A classification report is generated, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (spam and ham). The accuracy of the model is also calculated.

This project aims to accurately classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on their content, providing a valuable tool for email filtering and reducing unwanted messages.
